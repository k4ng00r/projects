# 🦘 Random Life Advice Generator

G’day mates!

Meet **Kangaroo**, the ultimate king of life. Back in Melbourne, Australia, Kangaroo had it all: the ladies, the drinks, epic rides across the outback. Money was never an issue — he came from a wealthy family — and he only worked for the thrill, hopping from one gig to another just for fun. A true social butterfly and the soul of every party.

Until one fateful night in Sydney… someone slipped a slightly too big box of acid into his beer. Oh, if only Kangaroo had the **Random Life Advice Generator** back then! It might’ve told him, “Mate, this ain’t gonna end well.” But he knew exactly what he was doing — eyes wide open — and downed that psycho beer anyway.

The result? Kangaroo blacked out. He woke up in transit to a Polish zoo. Somehow, he escaped and found himself living as a homeless wanderer in a country where the vodka aisle is bigger than the cheese aisle. Rough times. Real rough.

💡 Enter the **Random Life Advice Generator**: Kangaroo’s first app, crafted to maybe save future party kings and queens from similar fates. Simple, fun, and a little cheeky, it gives you random life advice whenever you need it — hopefully keeping you out of trouble and in one piece.
