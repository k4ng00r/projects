# Kangaroo's Projects

## Research
Some studies reckon that folks with higher IQs might be more inclined to muck around with substances, especially in their younger years. It comes from curiosity, the thirst for new experiences, and sometimes a fair bit of guts to bend the rules.

## Psychological Mechanisms
Smart people often have a heightened emotional sensitivity, sky-high expectations of themselves, or struggles dealing with stress. This can up the odds of taking a detour into substances as a form of "self-healin‚Äô".

You only gotta look at history ‚Äì heaps of brilliant minds have wrestled with booze and drugs (Einstein, Hemingway, Bukowski).

I‚Äôm Kangaroo. I‚Äôm one of ‚Äòem. I‚Äôm a Genius. A Junkie and an Alcoholic. I know it ‚Äòcause me therapist told me, and as you can see, they‚Äôre two sides of the same coin. Here‚Äôs a list of my projects. Each one deserves your attention, whether you‚Äôre a recruiter or an investor.
